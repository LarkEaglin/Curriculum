My name is Lark Eaglin and I have designed this curriculum for a 10 day workshop held at M.A.P Gaming Tech in Baltimore, MD Aug 2022. The workshop was intended to introduce children ages 9-12 the art of video game development.
Through my partnership with ANXReality I successfully led the rpogram and all of the students completed and presented their own design of the classic Snake game.
